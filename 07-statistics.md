## <a name="section-a"></a>1.  Introduction

[<img src="img/think_stats.jpg" title="Think Stats"/>](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/)

Use Allen Downey's [Think Stats (second edition)](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/) book for getting up to speed with core ideas in statistics and how to approach them programmatically. This book is available online, or you can buy a paper copy if you would like.

Use this book as a reference when answering the 6 required statistics questions below.  The Think Stats book is approximately 200 pages in length.  **It is recommended that you read the entire book, particularly if you are less familiar with introductory statistical concepts.**

Complete the following exercises along with the questions in this file. Some can be solved using code provided with the book. The preface of Think Stats [explains](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2001.html#toc2) how to use the code.  

Communicate the problem, how you solved it, and the solution, within each of the following [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files. (You can include code blocks and images within markdown.)

## <a name="section-b"></a>2.  Why We Are Using Think Stats 

The stats exercises have been chosen to introduce/solidify some relevant statistical concepts related to data science.  The solutions for these exercises are available in the [ThinkStats repository on GitHub](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2).  You should focus on understanding the statistical concepts, python programming and interpreting the results.  If you are stuck, review the solutions and recode the python in a way that is more understandable to you. 

For example, in the first exercise, the author has already written a function to compute Cohen's D.  **You could import it, or you could write your own code to practice python and develop a deeper understanding of the concept.** 

Think Stats uses a higher degree of python complexity from the python tutorials and introductions to python concepts, and that is intentional to prepare you for the bootcamp.  

**One of the skills to learn here is to understand other people’s code.  And this author is quite experienced, so it’s good to learn how functions and imports work.**

## <a name="section-d"></a>4.  Required Exercises

*Include your Python code, results and explanation (where applicable).*

### Q1. [Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](statistics/2-4-cohens_d.md) (effect size of Cohen's d)  
Cohen's D is an example of effect size.  Other examples of effect size are:  correlation between two variables, mean difference, regression coefficients and standardized test statistics such as: t, Z, F, etc. In this example, you will compute Cohen's D to quantify (or measure) the difference between two groups of data.   

You will see effect size again and again in results of algorithms that are run in data science.  For instance, in the bootcamp, when you run a regression analysis, you will recognize the t-statistic as an example of effect size.

### Q2. [Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](statistics/3-1-actual_biased.md) (actual vs. biased)
This problem presents a robust example of actual vs biased data.  As a data scientist, it will be important to examine not only the data that is available, but also the data that may be missing but highly relevant.  You will see how the absence of this relevant data will bias a dataset, its distribution, and ultimately, its statistical interpretation.

### Q3. [Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](statistics/4-2-random_dist.md) (random distribution)  
This questions asks you to examine the function that produces random numbers.  Is it really random?  A good way to test that is to examine the pmf and cdf of the list of random numbers and visualize the distribution.  If you're not sure what pmf is, read more about it in Chapter 3.  

### Q4. [Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](statistics/5-1-blue_men.md) (normal distribution of blue men)
This is a classic example of hypothesis testing using the normal distribution.  The effect size used here is the Z-statistic. 



### Q5. Bayesian (Elvis Presley twin) 

Bayes' Theorem is an important tool in understanding what we really know, given evidence of other information we have, in a quantitative way.  It helps incorporate conditional probabilities into our conclusions.

Elvis Presley had a twin brother who died at birth.  What is the probability that Elvis was an identical twin? Assume we observe the following probabilities in the population: fraternal twin is 1/125 and identical twin is 1/300.  

>>

P(Identical Twin | Twin) = P(Twin | Identical Twin) x P(Identical Twin) / P(Twin)

P(Twin | Identical Twin) = 1 
P(Identical Twin) = 1/300
P(Twin) = 1/300 + 1/125

P(Identical Twin | Twin) = .294 

The probability that Elvis was a identaical twin is 29.4%

### Q6. Bayesian &amp; Frequentist Comparison  
How do frequentist and Bayesian statistics compare?

>>

According to frequentist definitions of probability, only repeatable random events, such as rolling a dice, flipping a coin, and drawing a card from a deck, have probabilities. These probabilities are equal to the long-term frequency of the events in question. For example, there is no probability of rolling an odd number in a single roll. The true probability is equal to the percentage of “odd number” outcomes from a hypothetical series of infinite number of rolls.* Or the probability of rolling a six with a fair six-sided dice given that you roll the dice 1 million times will be extremely close to the outcome’s probability of 1/6, and it would be much closer to the probability of 1/6 than if you only rolled the dice 100 times. The frequentist approach does not attached probabilities to hypotheses or to any fixed but unknown values, such as the exact percentage of all humans who are 6 feet tall (since it would be impossible to measure all 7 billion people). However, frequentist would collect data from a sample of the population and determine its mean as the maximum likelihood estimate that would represent the entire population.


On the other hand the Bayesian view of probabilities is that it can be more generalized. It can be applied to single events and there is no repeatability requirement. Probabilities can be used to represent uncertainty in any event or hypothesis. For example it is acceptable to assign probabilities to non-repeatable events such as President Trump will be impeached in 2019 – something that Frequentist would claim impossible because his presidential term cannot be simulated an infinite number of times to determine how many times he was impeached. In this view probabilities are a measure of degree of belief and logical soundness. In other words, probabilities represent how certain you are about the truth of statements. These statements can refer to the past, the present, or the future.* 


In the example above, a Bayesian approach would be to define a probability distribution over the possible values of the mean (number of people at 6 feet tall) and then analyze sample data to update the distribution (using Bayes’ theorem). Probabilities are updated using Bayes’ theorem, where your initial belief is your prior probability for an event, which can be updated into a posterior probability with new information.* Frequentists typically do not update probabilities with Bayes’ theorem, but with direct physical observations. 


In the simplest terms, Frequentist Statistics may be more accurate since it is based on actual recorded frequencies of events, however it is more limited than Bayesian Statistics because of the view that probabilities cannot be applied to hypotheses and it cannot address uncertainty. Whereas Bayesian Statistics can be applied to single occurrences or events, views probabilities as distributions and can update these distributions with new data.

## <a name="section-e"></a>5.  Optional Exercises

The following exercises are optional, but we highly encourage you to complete them if you have the time.

### Q7. [Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](statistics/7-1-weight_vs_age.md) (correlation of weight vs. age)
In this exercise, you will compute the effect size of correlation.  Correlation measures the relationship of two variables, and data science is about exploring relationships in data.    

### Q8. [Think Stats Chapter 8 Exercise 2](statistics/8-2-sampling_dist.md) (sampling distribution)
In the theoretical world, all data related to an experiment or a scientific problem would be available.  In the real world, some subset of that data is available.  This exercise asks you to take samples from an exponential distribution and examine how the standard error and confidence intervals vary with the sample size.

### Q9. [Think Stats Chapter 6 Exercise 1](statistics/6-1-household_income.md) (skewness of household income)
### Q10. [Think Stats Chapter 8 Exercise 3](statistics/8-3-scoring.md) (scoring)
### Q11. [Think Stats Chapter 9 Exercise 2](statistics/9-2-resampling.md) (resampling)
